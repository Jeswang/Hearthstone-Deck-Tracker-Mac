- [Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker](https://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker): All the resources came from Epix37's project, and I learned a lot from reading the code.
- [hearthstone-tracker-osx](https://github.com/hellozimi/hearthstone-tracker-osx): Using hellozimi's code to monitor the log file saved me a lot of time.
